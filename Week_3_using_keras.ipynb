This neural network will comprise two layers, each with 10 nodes, and an input layer with 784 nodes corresponding to the image pixels. The specific structure of the neural network is outlined below, where $X$ represents the input, $A^{[0]}$ denotes the first layer, $Z^{[1]}$ signifies the unactivated layer 1, $A^{[1]}$ stands for the activated layer 1, and so forth.
